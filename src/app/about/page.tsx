            Tokenizer is an outer core project from the 42 curriculum as a web3 related project.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project I wanted to go beyond the requirements for the project by providing a tool to put in good use what an NFT could bring as the subject for the project, by the time I subscribed for it, was open enough to allow that.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal for me was to incorporate the 42 Curriculum into project in some way and to regard students for their achievements using an NFT that can only be obtained based on the achievement. For that I used 42 API, regarding students that, like me, made it to pass the Common Core becoming thus becoming members of the 42 network for life.
